# chessBoard-game
Chess game I am currently using as a learning experience

All images came from chess-board.js.

I got into programming in the summer of 2021 and wanted to do a fun project that could help expand my understanding of JavaScript.  Chess is very near and dear to my
heart so I am trying to create a chess game using pure JavaScript.  

This is a WIP but the end goal is to include all rules of a chess game, excluding touch move.  Feedback is welcome and encouraged as I am only just getting into 
programming.  You may see some things that will mae you turn your head a little.  Feel free to point it out :D.

I would like to thank my mentor on this project @CandiceJoy for helping me keep some of my code clean and explaining a few things along the way.
